# TinDog-Website
Using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap


I got a challenge when I learn Full Stack Web-Development Course on Udemy to create a TinDog-Website using Bootstrap... I completed that challenge and thought to put this on my github repository. TinDog version of this website only display the static part of website i.e. I only used Bootstrap to give the look to website. Nothing more than that.
Whereas the original concept is given below for your reference...ðŸ˜Š

About TinDog---

www.tindog.co --- the first social app for dog lovers who want to connect with other owners nearby that share a similar passion for canines. Whether it's to build new friendships or make a love connection, Tindog is a fun way to find the "pawfect" match with a little help from our furry friends.

Based on GPS location, Tindog will suggest nearby matches and â€“ much like Tinder â€“ allows users to swipe left (nope) or right (has potential) through recommended profiles. If both users swipe right, then it's a match and the new friends can chat to learn more or arrange a meet-up.

"Dogs bring so much joy and love, that they really have the power to connect us. That's why we wanted to make it easy for dog lovers to meet new people around them who feel the same way," said Julien Muller, Founder & CEO of Holidog. "Whether it's building new friendships or even making a love connection, Tindog is a great way to expand your social circle with others who love man's best friend just as much as you do."

Tindog is also a great way to help socialize your pet. Dogs are pack animals so it's equally as important to help them meet other dogs in the area. By matching with neighborhood dogs, Fido will never have to walk or play in the park alone again.

Created by the team at Holidog â€“ a 500 Startups company â€“ Tindog aims to help make it easier for people to break the ice once they match. "Most dating apps focus solely on appearances, which often leads nowhere," said Dave McClure, CEO of 500 Startups. "Matching with someone that already shares your love for dogs only increases the chance for a real connection â€“ plus everyone knows that dogs make the best wingmen."

Tindog is available on Android and beginning today, can be downloaded on iOS. To learn more about the Tindog app, please visit www.tindog.co.

I hope you like my Bootstrap TinDog Website. Thanks a lot to all of you for going through this. Please make sure to give your valuable feedback for scope of my improvement.ðŸ˜Š
